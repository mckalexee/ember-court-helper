## 1. Core Mechanics Overview

The Ember Court is the Venthyr Covenant's unique Sanctum feature in World of Warcraft: Shadowlands. Players host weekly parties, inviting guests from across the Shadowlands. The goal is to maximize each guest's happiness by tuning five **atmosphere dimensions** to match their preferences.

Before each event, the player selects:
- **Guests** (via RSVP slots)
- **Entertainment** (managed by Hips)
- **Refreshments** (managed by Picky Stefan)
- **Decorations** (managed by Boot the Beaut)
- **Security** (managed by Watchmaster Boromod)

Each choice shifts the court's atmosphere along the five dimensions. During the event, activities further modify the atmosphere. At the end, each guest's happiness is evaluated based on how well the final atmosphere matches their preferences.

---

## 2. Atmosphere Dimensions

There are five atmosphere dimensions, each a spectrum between two opposing poles:

| Dimension     | Low End (Left) | High End (Right) |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Cleanliness   | Messy          | Clean            |
| Danger        | Safe           | Dangerous        |
| Decadence     | Humble         | Decadent         |
| Excitement    | Relaxing       | Exciting         |
| Formality     | Casual         | Formal           |

Each guest prefers one pole or the other on one or more dimensions. The more the court's atmosphere matches a guest's preferences, the happier they become.

---

## 3. Complete Guest List & Preferences

There are 16 guests total. Each guest has preferences for 1, 2, or 3 atmosphere dimensions. Guests in higher RSVP slots have more preference dimensions, making them harder to satisfy but also more rewarding.

## 11. Happiness & Scoring System

### Happiness Tiers

Guest happiness is evaluated at the end of the Ember Court event. There are 6 tiers, from worst to best:

| Happiness Level | Reward Quality | Reputation Gain | Description                       |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Miserable       | None          | Minimal/None    | Atmosphere completely mismatched  |
| Unhappy         | Very Poor     | Very Low        | Mostly mismatched atmosphere      |
| Uncomfortable   | Poor          | Low             | Partially mismatched              |
| Comfortable     | Moderate      | Moderate        | Neutral / partially matched       |
| Happy           | Good          | Good            | Mostly matched atmosphere         |
| Elated          | Best          | Maximum         | All preferences fully matched     |

### How Scoring Works

1. **Pre-Event Setup:** Selecting entertainment, refreshments, decorations, and security shifts the atmosphere along the 5 dimensions. Each option provides a push toward one pole on two dimensions.

2. **During the Event:** Completing in-event activities (2 per amenity category = up to 6-8 per event depending on staff) further shifts the atmosphere. There are also random events that offer choices between two opposing atmosphere shifts.

3. **Final Evaluation:** After the event, each guest's happiness is determined by how many of their preference dimensions were satisfied:
   - A guest whose preferences are **all matched** by the court atmosphere will be **Elated**.
   - A guest whose preferences are **partially matched** will be somewhere in the middle.
   - A guest whose preferences are **actively contradicted** (opposite pole) will be **Miserable**.

4. **Friendship Level Bonus:** Higher friendship tiers with a guest provide a baseline happiness boost, making it easier to reach Elated even with imperfect atmosphere matching.

### Key Scoring Principles

- Each atmosphere dimension appears to function as a sliding scale. Options push the atmosphere toward one end.
- Stacking multiple options that push the same direction amplifies the effect.
- Contradictory options (one pushing +Clean, another pushing +Messy) cancel each other out.
- Guests with more preference dimensions (Tier 3 and 4) are harder to fully satisfy because you need to match more axes simultaneously.
- **Party Crasher events** can provide large atmosphere bonuses if handled correctly.
- **Random events** during the court provide dual-choice activities where each choice boosts one specific atmosphere pole.

### Reputation Gains

- All reward chests grant **Ember Court faction reputation** proportional to happiness level.
- Each guest also provides **individual friendship reputation** proportional to their happiness.
- More guests present = more total reputation gained per event.
- Elated yields the maximum anima rewards, maximum reputation, and access to the rarest reward drops.

## 12. Friendship / Guest Reputation Tiers

Each guest has an individual friendship reputation track. Progressing through tiers unlocks rewards and provides gameplay benefits.

| Friendship Tier | Effect / Benefit                                                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stranger        | Starting level; no bonuses                                          |
| Acquaintance    | Small baseline happiness bonus when attending                       |
| Friend          | Larger baseline happiness bonus; unlocks first reward tier          |
| Good Friend     | Significant happiness bonus; unlocks second reward tier             |
| Best Friend     | Maximum happiness bonus; account-wide skip of weekly unlock quest   |

## 13. In-Event Activities & Atmosphere Effects

Each Ember Court event features up to 10 activities:
- **6 from Amenities:** 2 each from Entertainment, Refreshments, and Decorations (or more with staff upgrades)
- **2 Random Events:** Dual-choice activities with opposing atmosphere effects
- **Party Crasher Events:** Invasion-style events with boss encounters

### Random Event Examples

Random events present a choice between two opposing atmosphere poles. Examples include:

- Fashion conflict: choose +Formal or +Casual resolution
- Pest management: choose +Clean or +Messy approach
- Statue commissioning: choose +Humble or +Decadent style
- Gossip spreading: choose +Relaxing or +Exciting reaction

---

## 14. Party Crasher Events

Five types of party crasher invasions can occur. Each provides a large atmosphere bonus if the associated boss is defeated:

| Crasher Type | Atmosphere Bonus on Success |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Type 1       | +Relaxing (large)           |
| Type 2       | +Decadent (large)           |
| Type 3       | +Clean (large)              |
| Type 4       | +Formal (large)             |
| Type 5       | +Safe (large)               |

Party crashers only spawn if their atmosphere bonus would benefit the invited guests.

## 15. Sanctum Upgrade Tiers

The Ember Court sanctum is upgraded through the Party Palace system at Sinfall.

| Rank | Name              | Anima Cost | Redeemed Souls | Research Time | Benefit                          |
|------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | New Court         | 1,000     | 1              | 1 hour        | Establishes the Ember Court      |
| 2    | Homegrown Help    | 5,000     | 8              | 12 hours      | Unlocks dredger butler; Slot 2   |
| 3    | Court Influencer  | 10,000    | 22             | 1 day         | Unlocks 3rd guest slot (Slot 3)  |

| 5    | Professionals     | 15,000    | 40             | 1 day         | Unlocks 5th specialist staff     |

---

## 16. Optimal Guest Pairings

Since guests in the same party share the same atmosphere, the key optimization strategy is to invite guests with **compatible or identical preferences**. Guests with opposing preferences (e.g., one wants Messy, another wants Clean) will be impossible to both satisfy fully.

### Perfect Synergy Pairs (No Conflicting Preferences)

| Guest A                | Guest B               | Shared/Compatible Preferences       | Conflicting |
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|

| Decadence   | Kleia & Pelagos, Alexandros Mograine, Mikanikos         | The Countess, Baroness Vashj                         |
